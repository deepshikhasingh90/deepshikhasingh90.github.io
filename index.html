            <p>I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer aspirant. I was working with Accenture India for the
                past 4yrs as a test Engineer analyst. I have a degree in Computer Engineering and 
                i am currently enrolled in UW coding bootcamp.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I hail from the beautiful country India and currently based in Seattle.
                Moving to the United States was a big move for me,it meant starting everything over again.
                I decided to make most of the opportunity and change my career path, learn to
                code since it always had my interest. I am focused on learning my way around coding.
                At this moment, I am just starting my journey, but I hope to be able to show off my skills in no time.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>When i am not coding i like to read books and spend time with my awesome husband. I am still
            exploring Seattle and i love it so far.I am a travel enthusiant and hope to see Europe real soon.
